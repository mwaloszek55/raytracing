*   An instructional Ray-Tracing Renderer written
*   for MIT 6.837  Fall '98 by Leonard McMillan.
*
*   A fairly primitive Ray-Tracing program written
*   on a Sunday afternoon before Monday's class.
*   Everything is contained in a single file. The
*   structure should be fairly easy to extend, with
*   new primitives, features and other such stuff.
*
*   I tend to write things bottom up (old K&R C
*   habits die slowly). If you want the big picture
*   scroll to the applet code at the end and work
*   your way back here.
